Introduction of HTTP:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that is, 
currently, the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

The first usable version of Introduction of HTTP was created in 1997. 
Because it went through several stages of development, this first version 
of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015,
a new version of HTTP called HTTP2 was created.

Differences between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1:

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource 
cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.  
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of 
data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource

HTTP/1.1 compresses data by itself.	
HTTP/2uses HPACK for data compression.

HTTP/1.1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
HTTP/2  uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

HTTP1.1 used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles. 
HTTP/2 will use binary commands (in 1s and 0s) to execute the same tasks. 

HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches


HTTP2 Multiplexing
Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, 
both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. 
HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates 
redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from 
every HTTP packet. Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a 
single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.
